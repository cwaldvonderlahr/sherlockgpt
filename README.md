# SherlockGPT - An AI-Driven Murder Mystery

This game experiment is inspired by "WhoDunit" by Henrik Kniberg:

It was (mostly) live-coded on Twitch by Wolfgang Schoch: https://www.twitch.tv/herrschoch

Have fun exploring the code.

# Detective Game Backend

This project is an example of a backend for a detective game using Flask and the OpenAI API.

## Installation

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

4. Start the application:

```sh
python backend/app.py
```

5. Open the game in your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

# Notes

- All game data is stored in a SQLite database: `sherlockgpt/instance/scenarios.db`. There is a sample database with game data that corresponds to the provided images and JSON files. It is named `scenarios.db.example`. Simply rename it to `scenarios.db` and place it in `sherlockgpt/instance/` to get started.
- There are some helper methods to rebuild the database, etc. Look for the `/admin` endpoints in `routes.py`.
- Don't forget: this is just a little experiment and not a full game. ðŸ˜‰
